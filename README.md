This repo contatins the prototype for our core gameplay, and we plan to add the main game here.

## Core Gameplay Prototype
The core gameplay prototype is here in our main repo.
- Audio: Audio sample made by our groupmate Ben for clicking on the screen. We used Mario Kart music as a sample for our looping music.
- Visual: We used 2 Phaser Graphics objects for our visual assets. I used a sample image of Shinji Ikari and some pizza I found on the internet for our background images.
- Motion is defined by the first message being made on screen, as if it was being typed out.
- Progression: The player progresses through the dialogue by clicking on the screen. They are then able to make a dialogue decision that branches into a different display message.
- Prefabs: "Test" class that handles all dialogue processing. JSON files being parsed from the "Test" class to load dialogue.
